      "When raising capital through private placements in India, companies must comply with provisions such as registering with the Registrar of Companies and following proper allotment filing procedures. Foreign companies issuing depository receipts in foreign countries must also adhere to global depository receipt regulations and register with the Registrar of Companies within 30 days of establishing their place of business in India.\n",

      "Differences between private placements and public offerings are as follows:\n",
      "1. Private Placements require offers or invitations to a select group, which are not considered public offers.\n",
      "2. No prospectus is required for private placements, but proceeds must be kept in a separate bank account for adjustment against allotments or repayment of monies if unable to allot securities.\n",
      "3. Companies must maintain records of offers made under this section and file information with the Registrar within 30 days of circulation of the relevant private placement offer letter.\n",
      "4. No public advertisements can be released for private placements, while a prospectus must be issued for public offerings, containing the terms of contracts and other relevant information, subject to regulatory compliance.\n",
      "5. Default in complying with public offering provisions may result in fines and/or imprisonment for officers involved in the company.\n"
